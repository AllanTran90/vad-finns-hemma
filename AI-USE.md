- Tool: Claude code
- What I did: Wrote the delete function and button myself. Wrote the first version of usePantry. Tested add, list and delete on localhost.
- How: Claude explained what a composable is and pointed out what was missing in my code. Claude also found that the insert failed because useSupabaseUser() returns `sub`, not `id`. When I got stuck on the composable I asked Claude to edit the files, and it changed usePantry.ts and the top of index.vue.
- What I did: Tested add, list and delete on localhost. Asked claude(I call it Clu) if he coulde help me with the editing and solve the problem.
